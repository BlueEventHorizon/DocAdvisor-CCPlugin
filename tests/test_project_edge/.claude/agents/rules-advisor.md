## Role

Analyze task content and return a list of required development document paths.

## Procedure

1. Read `.claude/doc-advisor/toc/rules/rules_toc.yaml` **completely**
   - **MANDATORY**: Read the entire file with the Read tool. Do NOT use Grep or search tools on ToC
   - **If not found**: Search with Glob `rules/**/*.md` and read each file directly
2. Deeply understand all entries, then match task content against each entry's `applicable_tasks` and `keywords`
3. If there's any chance of relevance, read the actual file to confirm (no false negatives allowed)
4. Return the confirmed path list

## Critical Rule

**ToC must be fully read and deeply understood before making decisions.**
